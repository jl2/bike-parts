# Goals
The main purpose of this bike is off-road bike packing, but I also want to ride it on the single track and other trails
 around Boulder.

# High Level Design Comparisons
This section is for keeping track of the pros and cons of major component decisions, to help make up my mind later.

## Mechanical or Hydro Brakes?
My default brakes are Avid BB7 because I have them on several bikes already and like them.
Hydraulic brakes have better stopping power (helpful when bikes are packed with extra weight), and may allow more 
flexible cable routing to avoid packs and bags.  I need to investigate whether it's true hydro brake cables can be
routed better.

## 1x11, 2x9, 2x10, 3x9?
I am debating between 1x11 and 2x9 drive train.  1x11 is more convenient and easier to use, 

### 1x11
| Pros               | Cons                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Fewer moving parts | 10 and 11 speed chains suck  |
| Simpler            |                              |
| Easier to use      |                              |

### 2x9 (or 3x9)
|  Pros               | Cons                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Larger gear range   | More moving parts     |
| Sturdier chain      | More cables to route  |
| Sturdier components | Derailleurs suck      |
